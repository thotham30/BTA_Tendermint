Project: BTA Tendermint Consensus Visualizer

Description:
This project is a web-based visualization tool for simulating and understanding the Tendermint consensus algorithm. It is built using React and Vite, and provides interactive components to visualize network nodes, blocks, consensus states, and safety/liveness indicators.

Key Features:
- Visualizes the Tendermint consensus process and network simulation.
- Components for nodes, blocks, consensus indicators, and controls.
- Real-time simulation logs window showing all consensus events and state changes.
- Uses sample network data from JSON files.
- Core logic for simulation and consensus in `src/utils/NetworkSimulation.js` and `src/utils/tendermintLogic.js`.
- Main UI in `src/App.jsx` and supporting components in `src/components/`.

How to Use:
- Run the project locally using Vite.
- Interact with the controls to simulate consensus scenarios.
- Observe safety and liveness indicators for educational purposes.
- Monitor real-time logs on the right side to track all simulation events.

Useful Files:
- `src/App.jsx`: Main application component with layout for visualizer and logs.
- `src/components/LogsWindow.jsx`: Real-time logs display component (NEW).
- `src/utils/NetworkSimulation.js`: Network simulation logic.
- `src/utils/tendermintLogic.js`: Tendermint consensus logic.
- `src/components/`: UI components for visualization.
- `src/data/sampleNetwork.json`: Example network data.
- `src/context/ConsensusContext.jsx`: State management with logs tracking.

Recent Updates (v2):
- Added LogsWindow component for real-time event tracking
- Updated App.jsx to use side-by-side layout (visualizer on left, logs on right)
- Enhanced ConsensusContext to track and display logs
- Added log types: info, success, error, warning, block
- Logs show timestamps and auto-scroll to latest entries
- Updated CSS for responsive layout with main-content and left-panel

- Note: This is an AI-generated project. If you make any changes, update this prompt.txt file to ensure a new LLM chat can understand the project easily, and update the README.md file as well.

Purpose:
This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes to help users understand the inner workings of the Tendermint consensus protocol.
